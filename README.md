# Introduction to Neural Networks.  
Artificial neural networks is a big part of our personal and work life today, Be it youtube recommending a new song or Amazon suggesting a compliment product But what is behind this mask?  how did it all start? And, why is it revival and popular NOW?  
### How did it all start?
In a simplist form neural networks mimics the way human brain operates. the ability to learn, adopt in a changing a enviroment, analyze incomplete  and  unclear,  fuzzy  information, and  make  its  own judgment  out  of  it using circuit of neurons

Why is Artificial intelligence popular Now while neural networks date back decades?

because :
          1. Big Data
          2. Hardware
          3. Software  
Big Data - According to Forbes "There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day at our current pace, but that pace is only accelerating with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT). Over the last two years alone 90% of the data in the world was generated."  
huge data generated today and the easier collection & storage make neural networks resurgence to learn and productize into Appilications.  
Hardware - Masive parallelizable and the intoduction of GPUs for Computational processing ease the implementation of Artificial intelligence.  
Software - Continuos improvement in Technology, new Models & Algorithms with the help of Toolboxes like TensorFlow makes neural network Appilication easier and popular.
